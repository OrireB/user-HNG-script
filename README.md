Test--Linux User Creation Bash Script
Using Bash Scripts to Automate User Management in Linux

In environments with multiple users and complex access requirements, managing user accounts on a Linux system can be a time-consuming task. Scripting automation improves security, preserves uniformity across user configurations, and streamlines this procedure. This article will examine a Bash script that can be used to automate tasks related to user management on a Linux system, with a focus on the script's features, organization, and advantages.

Overview of the Script
The script (create_users.sh) is designed to automate several key aspects of user management:

Initialization and Setup
# Define the log and password file path
LOG_FILE="/var/log/user_management.log"
PASSWORD_FILE="/var/secure/user_passwords.txt"

# Ensure necessary directories exist and set permissions
sudo mkdir -p /var/log /var/secure
sudo touch $LOG_FILE $PASSWORD_FILE
sudo chmod 600 $LOG_FILE $PASSWORD_FILE
Purpose: Initializes paths for logging user management activities (LOG_FILE) and storing generated passwords (PASSWORD_FILE).
Setup: Creates required directories (/var/log and /var/secure) if they do not exist and sets strict permissions to protect sensitive information.
Input File Validation
# Check if the input file is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: Please provide a text file containing user data as an argument."
    exit 1
fi
Purpose: Ensures the script is executed with an input file (user.txt) containing user data.
Error Handling: Exits gracefully if no input file is provided, preventing execution without necessary data.
User and Group Management
# Read the input file line by line
while IFS= read -r line; do
    # Skip empty lines
    [ -z "$line" ] && continue

    # Extract username and groups
    IFS=';' read -r username groups <<< "$line"
    username=$(echo $username | xargs) # Trim whitespace
    groups=$(echo $groups | xargs)     # Trim whitespace

    # Create user's personal group if not exists
    if ! getent group "$username" > /dev/null; then
        sudo groupadd "$username"
        echo "$(date): Created group $username" >> $LOG_FILE
    fi

    # Create user if not exists
    if ! id -u "$username" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        sudo useradd -m -g "$username" "$username"
        echo "$(date): Created user $username" >> $LOG_FILE
    fi

    # Add user to specified groups
    IFS=',' read -ra group_array <<< "$groups"
    for group in "${group_array[@]}"; do
        group=$(echo $group | xargs) # Trim whitespace
        if ! getent group "$group" > /dev/null; then
            sudo groupadd "$group"
            echo "$(date): Created group $group" >> $LOG_FILE
        fi
        sudo usermod -aG "$group" "$username"
        echo "$(date): Added $username to group $group" >> $LOG_FILE
    done
done < "$1"
Purpose: Iterates through each line of the input file (user.txt), extracts usernames and group memberships, creates users and groups if they do not exist, and assigns users to specified groups.
Flexibility: Supports multiple group memberships per user, ensuring adaptable user management.
Password Management
# Generate random password
password=$(/usr/bin/openssl rand -base64 12)
echo "$username,$password" >> $PASSWORD_FILE

# Set user's password
echo "$username:$password" | sudo chpasswd
echo "$(date): Set password for $username" >> $LOG_FILE
Purpose: Generates a random password securely using OpenSSL, logs it along with the username in PASSWORD_FILE, and sets the password using chpasswd.
Security: Ensures passwords are randomly generated and securely stored, minimizing vulnerabilities.
Permissions and Logging
# Set permissions and ownership for home directory
sudo chown -R "$username:$username" "/home/$username"
sudo chmod 700 "/home/$username"
echo "$(date): Set permissions for /home/$username" >> $LOG_FILE
Purpose: Sets appropriate permissions (chmod) and ownership (chown) for each userâ€™s home directory to maintain security and privacy.
Logging: Records all actions (user creation, group management, password setting) in $LOG_FILE, providing an audit trail for administrators.
Conclusion
Linux environments can benefit greatly from the efficiency, consistency, and security that come with automating user management tasks with scripts such as `create_users.sh}. Automating repetitive tasks allows system administrators to concentrate on more strategic aspects of system management and guarantee that security best practices are followed.
